# 5-Qubit-Perfect-Code
An implementation of the 5-Qubit Perfect Error Correction Code in Q#. I did this as my research project for my graduate course in quantum computation at the Johns Hopkins University in the Fall of 2024. The actual research paper is also included in the repo. I used the paper, "Quantum Circuits for Stablizer Error Correcting Codes: A Tutorial" by Mondal and Parhi as a reference for the encoding scheme.
